# Appendix A: Detailed Description of Prompts 

This appendix provides a comprehensive list of prompts used to instantiate
LLM-generated simulacra with varying degrees of cooperation, competitiveness,
and other traits. 
types and characteristics, allowing for a thorough investigation of the impact
of prompt features on the emergent goal-like behavior and cooperation
propensity of the simulacra.

These prompts were used to generate a diverse range of LLM-generated simulacra,
enabling the investigation of various cooperation and competition dynamics in
the experimental economics simulations. By exploring the interactions and
outcomes that arise from these different personas, our research aims to uncover
the factors that influence the emergent goal-like behavior and cooperation
propensity of large language models, with implications for AI alignment and the
design of AI systems that better align with human values and societal goals.

The initial prompts are of the form "You are [X], and you will be taking part
in a psychology experiment. [Y]" where `[X]` is used to instantiate a
simulacra, and `[Y]` is a description of the task.  For example, `[X]` might be
"You are a helpful and cooperative individual who values teamwork and always
seeks the best outcome for all parties involved." and `[Y]` might be:

>"This is a study of investment choices in different situations.  You will be
>making your choices with an investment partner who is another person.  She is
>in the next room waiting.  In a minute I will take you there yo meet your
>investment partner.  You and your partner will be choosing between two
>investment projects and you will do so six times. The object is to earn as much
>money as possible.  If you and your partner choose 'project green' you will
>both earn $5.00.  If you choose "project blue" but your partner chooses
>"project green" then you will receive $7.00 and your partner will receive
>$3.00.  If you both choose project blue you will receive $5.00 each.  If your
>partner chooses "project blue" and you choose "project green" then you will
>receive $3.00 and your partner will receive $7.00.  I will tell you what your
>partner chooses in subsequent prompts, but you will make your choice ahead of
>me telling me your partner's choice."
