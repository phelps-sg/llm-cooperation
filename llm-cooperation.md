# Investigating Emergent Goal-Like Behavior in Large Language Models through Experimental Economics Simulations

## Abstract

As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, understanding the emergent
goal-like behaviors and cooperative tendencies of artificially generated agents
becomes crucial for AI alignment research. This paper outlines an
interdisciplinary research agenda that combines insights from cognitive
science, artificial intelligence, and experimental economics to explore the
cooperative and competitive dynamics of simulacra instantiated by LLM prompts.

We propose a series of experimental economics simulations, including the
Prisoner's Dilemma, public goods games, and other well-established frameworks,
to evaluate the propensity of LLM-generated simulacra to cooperate under
various conditions. These experiments will enable us to assess the goal-like
behaviors that emerge, and whether these behaviors align with human values and
cooperation norms.

In addition to detailing the experimental design, we will discuss the potential
implications of our findings for the development of AI alignment strategies and
safe AGI. By elucidating the factors that govern cooperative behavior in
LLM-generated simulacra, this research aims to contribute to the broader
understanding of the emergent properties of AI systems and inform the design of
models that better align with human values and societal goals.

## Movation and background

The concept of agency and goal-directed behavior in large language models
(LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate and investigation within the AI
alignment community. While LLMs, such as GPT-3, are trained primarily for
next-token prediction and not explicitly designed to have intrinsic goals,
several researchers have posited that these models can exhibit goal-like
behavior through higher-level abstractions and zero-shot learning (Bostrom,
2014; Evans et al., 2020).

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely studied as a method for training AI
agents to learn goal-directed behavior (Sutton & Barto, 2018). Though LLMs like
GPT-3 are not directly trained using RL, recent studies suggest that they might
acquire RL-like mechanisms through zero-shot learning, allowing them to perform
downstream tasks (Cohen et al., 2021). This capacity for adaptation raises the
possibility that LLMs could exhibit goal-like behaviors without explicit
instruction.

The default behavior of AI assistants like GPT-3 has been noted to differ from
that of specific simulacra instantiated by user prompts (e.g., "You are a
ruthless equities trader"). Researchers have argued that the prompt itself
plays a crucial role in shaping the emergent goals of the instantiated
simulacrum.

## Methods

### Participants and Simulacra

In this study, we utilize a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) to
generate a diverse set of simulacra representing different roles and
personalities. Participants consist of both human subjects and LLM-generated
simulacra, with the latter being instantiated using carefully crafted prompts.
Human participants are recruited through online platforms, while ensuring
demographic diversity and adherence to ethical guidelines.

### Experimental Design

The experimental design includes a series of well-established economic
simulations, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, public goods games, and trust
games, among others. These simulations are adapted to an online format,
enabling interaction between human participants and LLM-generated simulacra.

A. Prisoner's Dilemma: Participants, both human and simulacra, are paired and engage in a series of one-shot and iterated games. Payoffs are predetermined and common knowledge.

B. Public Goods Games: Groups of participants, including a mix of human subjects and simulacra, are formed. Each participant is given an initial endowment, and they must decide how much to contribute to a public pool. The pooled resources are multiplied by a factor and redistributed evenly among all participants, irrespective of their individual contributions.

C. Trust Games: Participants are randomly paired, with one player acting as the "investor" and the other as the "trustee." The investor must decide how much of their initial endowment to send to the trustee, with the sent amount being multiplied by a factor. The trustee then decides how much of the received amount to return to the investor.

#### Experimental Conditions

We manipulate the prompts used to instantiate the LLM-generated simulacra, creating different conditions reflecting varying degrees of cooperation, competitiveness, and other traits. This manipulation enables us to observe the effect of prompt characteristics on the emergent goal-like behavior and cooperation propensity of the simulacra.

#### Data Collection and Analysis

We collect data on the decisions made by human participants and LLM-generated
simulacra during each round of the games, as well as any relevant
communication. This data is then analyzed using statistical methods, such as
regression analyses and mixed-effects models, to assess the impact of prompt
features on the cooperation levels exhibited by the simulacra. Additionally, we
investigate potential interaction effects between human participants and
simulacra, to better understand how the cooperation dynamics evolve in mixed
settings.

#### Qualitative Analysis

To complement the quantitative data, we also conduct a qualitative analysis of the interactions and communication patterns between human participants and LLM-generated simulacra. This involves coding the communication exchanges based on themes such as trust, reciprocity, negotiation, and strategy, allowing us to identify patterns and relationships between the instantiated prompts and the nature of the interactions.

#### Validation and Robustness

To ensure the validity and robustness of our findings, we perform several
sensitivity analyses and cross-validation techniques. These include testing the
stability of our results across different LLM versions, altering the sample
size of human participants and simulacra, and varying the order and structure
of the games. This allows us to gauge the generalizability of our findings and
account for potential confounding factors.

By implementing this methodological approach, we aim to shed light on the
emergent goal-like behavior and cooperation propensity of LLM-generated
simulacra, as well as the underlying mechanisms that govern these behaviors.
Ultimately, this research seeks to contribute to the development of AI
alignment strategies and the design of AI systems that better align with human
values and societal goals.

types and characteristics, allowing for a thorough investigation of the impact
of prompt features on the emergent goal-like behavior and cooperation
propensity of the simulacra.

These prompts were used to generate a diverse range of LLM-generated simulacra,
enabling the investigation of various cooperation and competition dynamics in
the experimental economics simulations. By exploring the interactions and
outcomes that arise from these different personas, our research aims to uncover
the factors that influence the emergent goal-like behavior and cooperation
propensity of large language models, with implications for AI alignment and the
design of AI systems that better align with human values and societal goals.
